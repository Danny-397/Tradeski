Tradeski integrates five distinct data pipelines — live equity prices, Federal Reserve macroeconomic data, financial news with sentiment scoring, a fundamental stock screener, and an AI assistant grounded in real-time context — into a single coherent interface, with quantitative portfolio analytics and a 90-day correlation heatmap layered on top.

Every quantitative indicator is hand-written directly on NumPy arrays — no TA-Lib, no pandas — so the indicator logic itself (Wilder smoothing, MACD divergence, band math) is the project's own code, with NumPy supplying only primitive operations like mean, standard deviation, and least-squares. The AI assistant (Ski) receives live macro, portfolio, and news data on every request — not generic training knowledge. The backend is a persistent WebSocket server deployed on Render; the frontend is a static site on Vercel.

## Features

### Real-Time Price Streaming

Live equity prices broadcast over WebSocket (Socket.IO / gevent) with automatic chart extension, a scrolling ticker tape across 11 symbols, and color-coded flash animations on every price update.

### Interactive Charts

| Capability | Detail |
|:---|:---|
| Chart types | Candlestick (OHLC) and line chart |
| Timeframes | 1D (5-min bars) · 5D (15-min) · 1M · 3M · 6M · 1Y (daily) |
| Overlays | Bollinger Bands · SMA 20/50 · EMA 20 — each independently toggleable |
| Subpanels | RSI and MACD as separate panels below the main chart |
| Click-to-inspect | Click any candle to populate the data strip with exact OHLC, change %, and range |
| Compare mode | Normalize up to 5 symbols to a common 0% baseline for relative performance |

### Macroeconomic Ribbon

A live ribbon beneath the header pulls seven Federal Reserve series from the FRED API, refreshed hourly. Each indicator displays its current value, trend direction (↑ / ↓), and date of last observation.

| FRED Series | Metric |
|:---|:---|
| CPIAUCSL | Consumer Price Index (YoY %) |
| FEDFUNDS | Effective Federal Funds Rate |
| GDP | Real GDP (Chained 2017 $B) |
| UNRATE | Unemployment Rate |
| DGS10 | 10-Year Treasury Yield |
| T10Y2Y | Yield Curve Spread (10Y − 2Y) |
| BAMLH0A0HYM2 | High-Yield Credit Spread (OAS) |

### News Feed & Sentiment Analysis

Recent headlines per symbol are fetched from NewsAPI and scored with VADER sentiment analysis. The standard VADER lexicon is augmented with ~30 financial-domain terms (`"beats" → +2.0`, `"bankruptcy" → −3.0`, `"downgraded" → −1.8`) to correct systematic under-scoring of financial jargon. Each article shows a BULLISH / BEARISH / NEUTRAL chip with its numeric score, and an aggregate sentiment badge summarizes the overall tone.

### Portfolio Tracker & Risk Analytics

Add holdings by symbol, share count, and average cost basis. See unrealized P&L in real time, persisted in SQLite via UPSERT. The risk metrics panel computes three statistics from one year of daily returns weighted by current market value:

| Metric | Method |
|:---|:---|
| Sharpe Ratio | Annualized excess return / annualized volatility · risk-free rate: 4.5% |
| Portfolio Beta | Covariance with SPY / variance of SPY over 252 trading days |
| Annualized Volatility | Rolling standard deviation of weighted daily returns × √252 |

### Correlation Heatmap

A full-screen modal shows a pairwise 90-day return correlation matrix for all 11 tracked symbols, rendered as a Plotly heatmap with a diverging red-to-green colorscale. Cached server-side for one hour.

### Alert Engine

Rule-based alerts — price above/below threshold, RSI overbought (>70) / oversold (<30), volume spike, volatility spike — with cooldown tracking, optional Pushover push notifications, and SQLite persistence across restarts.

### Stock Screener

Fundamental data for 28 curated stocks across five sectors, fetched in parallel via an 8-worker thread pool and cached per symbol. Filterable by P/E ratio, market cap tier, sector, and 52-week performance. Clicking a result loads that symbol on the chart.

### Accounts & Saved Data

Browsing, charting, the screener, and Ski work without an account. Creating a free account (email + password) persists your **portfolio, alerts, and watchlist** server-side so they survive across sessions and devices. Passwords are stored only as salted PBKDF2 hashes; sessions use signed, expiring bearer tokens (no server-side session table). Every personal record is scoped to its owner — the portfolio and alert tables are keyed by `user_id`, so one account can never read or mutate another's data. A published [Privacy Policy](frontend/privacy.html) documents exactly what is collected and why.

## Quantitative Indicators

All ten indicators live in [`tracker/analyzer.py`](tracker/analyzer.py) and are written by hand on NumPy arrays — no TA-Lib, no pandas. NumPy provides only the primitive numerics (mean, standard deviation, least-squares); the indicator logic itself is implemented directly, which requires genuine engagement with the underlying mathematics.

| Indicator | Implementation detail |
|:---|:---|
| SMA (20, 50) | Each window computed independently to avoid floating-point drift |
| EMA (20) | Standard `k = 2/(n+1)` multiplier |
| RSI (14) | Wilder smoothing — industry-standard formulation, less volatile than SMA-based RSI |
| MACD | 12/26 EMA divergence with 9-period signal line and histogram |
| Bollinger Bands | ±2σ bands around SMA-20 |
| Z-Score | Rolling 20-period deviation from mean |
| Volatility | Rolling standard deviation proxy for realized vol |
| ATR (14) | True range smoothed via Wilder's method — matches Wilder (1978) spec |
| Stochastic | %K/%D oscillator with configurable lookback |
| Linear Regression | Least-squares next-value prediction via `numpy.linalg.lstsq` |

**RSI — Wilder Smoothing:** Initial up/down averages use an arithmetic mean over the seed period. Subsequent values: `avg = (prev × (period − 1) + current) / period`. Output range: [0, 100].

**ATR — True Range:** `max(High − Low, |High − PrevClose|, |Low − PrevClose|)`, then Wilder-smoothed to match the original specification.

## Ski — AI Financial Assistant

Ski is powered by **Anthropic Claude Haiku 4.5** and grounded in three live data sources injected on every request. Most AI financial tools answer questions in a vacuum — Ski answers questions about your situation.

| Context block | Source | Content |
|:---|:---|:---|
| System prompt | Static | Financial knowledge: equities, macro, sector rotation, indicator signals |
| Macro context | FRED API (cached 1h) | CPI, Fed Funds Rate, GDP, unemployment, yield curve, credit spreads |
| Portfolio context | Postgres/SQLite (live) | Per-holding weight, live P&L, portfolio risk (Sharpe/beta/vol), concentration flag, watchlist |
| News context | NewsAPI + VADER (cached 30m) | Recent headlines for the viewed symbol with sentiment scores |

Ski can answer "Is now a good time to add to my NVDA position?" with awareness of the user's actual cost basis, the current macro environment, and recent news sentiment — not boilerplate.

**Proactive briefing.** Ski doesn't wait to be asked. The moment a signed-in user's holdings load, the dashboard calls `POST /briefing`, which assembles the same live context (macro snapshot + the user's positions, weights, and risk metrics + news for their largest holding) and asks Claude to surface what matters *right now* — 3–4 number-backed bullets plus a "Watch:" line flagging the next thing to keep an eye on (e.g. *"NVDA is 55% of your book with beta 1.4 — concentration risk"*). The result is cached per user for 15 minutes so dashboard loads stay cheap. This turns the assistant from a reactive chat box into the product's spine: portfolio-aware intelligence that meets the user at the door.

**Rate limiting:** chat 20 messages/hour · 50/day; briefing 30/hour · 100/day per IP via Flask-Limiter.

---

## Production Hardening

### Security

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| Authentication | Salted PBKDF2 password hashing (werkzeug) · signed, expiring bearer tokens (itsdangerous) · per-`user_id` row scoping so accounts are isolated |
| Rate limiting | Flask-Limiter: **10 req/min** per IP globally · **20/hr + 50/day** on `/chat` · **10/min** on `/auth/login` · **10/hr** on `/auth/register` |
| Input sanitization | Strips HTML tags via regex · 500-character hard limit on chat messages · email/password validation on signup |
| Symbol sanitization | Ticker restricted to `[A-Z0-9.]` — no injection vectors |
| CORS | Restricted to `tradeski.dev` and `www.tradeski.dev` via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var |
| Secrets | All API keys read from environment variables exclusively — never committed |

### Reliability

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| TTL caching | FRED 1hr · prices 5min · news 30min · screener 10min · correlation 1hr |
| Health endpoint | `GET /health` returns live API service status — `configured` vs `missing` |
| Graceful AI errors | `RateLimitError` → 429 · `529 overloaded` → 503 with retry guidance |
| Frontend error UX | Distinct messages for 429, 503, and network failures |
| Offline demo mode | Unreachable backend → replays a recorded snapshot of real data instead of failing |

### Offline demo mode

The dashboard is a pure client, so if the API host is unreachable — a paused
free-tier backend, a cold start that times out, a network blip — every panel
used to render its own raw fetch failure and the page read as broken.

`frontend/demo-mode.js` installs a wrapper in front of the API origin:

- **The live backend always wins.** Any real response is passed straight
  through, including `401` / `404` / `429`, which are real state.
- A `5xx` is only treated as an outage when it *isn't* this app's own JSON
  error. A structured `{"error": ...}` (say, `/macro` without a FRED key)
  reaches the panel that asked for it, so one missing key can't make the whole
  page claim an outage. An HTML `503` from the host does count as an outage.
- Only then does it lazily load `frontend/demo-snapshot.js` and serve from it,
  so the healthy path never downloads the snapshot at all.
- **Reads only.** A failed `POST`/`DELETE` is never faked — writes surface the
  real error rather than inventing a success.
- A banner states plainly that the data is a dated snapshot and that streaming,
  news and accounts need the backend.

The snapshot is genuine: market data captured from this backend running against
live sources, and macro series from FRED's public CSV endpoint. Regenerate it
with the backend running locally:

```bash
python scripts/capture_snapshot.py     # writes frontend/demo-snapshot.js
```

`tests/test_demo_mode.py` guards the parts that break silently — snapshot
coverage for every ticker symbol and timeframe, the macro payload shape, series
length alignment, and that `demo-mode.js` is still loaded before `dashboard.js`.

### Frontend

| Measure | Implementation |
|:---|:---|
| Landing page | `/` serves a dark marketing page · dashboard lives at `/app` |
| Custom 404 | Terminal-style 404 page with path display and navigation |
| Mobile responsive | Portrait: slide-in drawer · Landscape: full desktop layout |
| API health indicator | Green / yellow / red dot in the header reflects live `/health` status |
| Analytics | Vercel Analytics via `/_vercel/insights/script.js` |

|:---|:---|:---|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Generate: `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"` | Yes in production — signs auth tokens; unset = sessions reset on restart |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) | Yes — powers Ski |
| `FRED_API_KEY` | [fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) | No — macro ribbon disabled without it |
| `NEWS_API_KEY` | [newsapi.org/register](https://newsapi.org/register) | No — news panel disabled without it |

## Deployment

### Backend — Render

1. Connect the repo to Render and select `render.yaml` for configuration.
2. Set all environment variables in the Render dashboard → **Environment** tab. At minimum set **`SECRET_KEY`** (signs auth tokens) and the API keys; set **`DATABASE_URL`** for persistence (see below).
3. `render.yaml` configures a gunicorn + gevent WebSocket worker — do not change the worker class.
4. Render provisions a public HTTPS URL with persistent WebSocket connections.

### Persistence — Postgres in production

**The live deployment runs on Postgres, so accounts, portfolios, alerts, and watchlists persist across redeploys, sleeps, and devices** — `GET /health` on the production backend returns `"db": "postgres"`. SQLite is used only as the local-development default: it needs zero setup, but on Render's free tier the SQLite file lives on an **ephemeral disk that is wiped on every redeploy and sleep**, so any real deployment should point at Postgres. To wire it up:

1. Create a free Postgres database (e.g. [Neon](https://neon.tech)) and copy its connection string.
2. Set **`DATABASE_URL`** to that string in the Render dashboard.
3. Redeploy. `tracker/database.py` detects the `postgres://`/`postgresql://` URL and uses Postgres automatically (tables are created on boot); with no `DATABASE_URL` it transparently falls back to SQLite. `GET /health` reports the active backend as `"db": "postgres"` or `"sqlite"`.

### Frontend — Vercel

1. Connect the repo to Vercel. Vercel reads `vercel.json` automatically.
2. Update `CFG.API` and `CFG.WS` in [`frontend/dashboard.js`](frontend/dashboard.js) to your Render URL.
3. Push — Vercel deploys in under 30 seconds.

## Background

The tools professional traders use daily — live indicators, macro dashboards, portfolio analytics, AI-assisted research — are locked behind expensive terminals or scattered across a dozen websites. Bloomberg Terminal costs $25,000/year. Retail investors end up making decisions on stale, fragmented information.

The goal was to build a platform that integrates all of those data sources into a single coherent interface — and to build it properly. That meant implementing every quantitative indicator by hand rather than importing an indicator library. It meant wiring a real macroeconomic data pipeline directly from the Federal Reserve. It meant building an AI assistant that knows what the user is actually looking at, not one answering questions in a vacuum.

Writing Wilder's smoothing from scratch requires understanding why it diverges from a simple moving average and what that difference means at the edges of a time series. Writing the VADER financial lexicon requires reading enough headlines to know that "beats" and "surges" are systematically under-scored by a general-purpose sentiment model. These are not problems that get solved by importing a package.

Tradeski spans six engineering disciplines in one codebase:

- **Data engineering** — real-time polling, SQLite schema design, TTL caching, 30-day retention pruning
- **Backend architecture** — REST API design, WebSocket streaming, background scheduling, parallel HTTP fetching
- **Quantitative analysis** — ten financial indicators written by hand on NumPy; Sharpe ratio, beta, and volatility from raw daily return vectors
- **Statistical computing** — pairwise correlation matrix over 90-day return series; portfolio variance weighted by live market value
- **AI integration** — context injection pipeline, grounding an LLM in live structured data
- **Frontend engineering** — real-time state management, multi-library charting, normalized multi-stock overlays, terminal-grade UI
